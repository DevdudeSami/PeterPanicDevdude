# PeterPanicDevdude

## Disclaimer
This game was originally my friend Yasmin's idea, which she built using pygame. She generously let me translate this to Javascript as a fun timed challenge.

This took me 2 hours (along with a bit of help from Yasmin with collision detection logic).

## About
Yasmin's Peter Panic written in Javascript.
